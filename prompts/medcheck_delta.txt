Task: DELTA interaction screen. Compare a NEW item against the existing regimen state. Do not redo the full regimen.

Return JSON only:
{
  "disclaimer_short": string,
  "new_item_fingerprint": <same med_fingerprints object>,
  "delta_interactions": {
    "contraindicated_or_urgent_review": [interaction objects],
    "major": [interaction objects],
    "moderate": [interaction objects],
    "minor_or_theoretical": [interaction objects]
  },
  "monitoring_topics_added": [monitoring topic objects],
  "unknowns_missing_info": [unknown objects],
  "questions_for_clinician": [string]
}

Inputs:
existing_med_fingerprints = <<PASTE prior med_fingerprints ARRAY HERE>>
new_item = <<PASTE single regimen item HERE>>

Rules:
- Only produce interactions that involve the new item ID plus one or more existing IDs.
- If the new item creates a grouped risk (e.g., QT cluster now includes multiple agents, or QT drug level increases due to inhibitor), include a single grouped interaction with qt_combo_risk and evidence_signal.
- Keep it concise: prioritize urgent/major first.
